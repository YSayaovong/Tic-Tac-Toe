# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game. The game can be played between two players, where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O". The objective is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.

## Game Features
- **Two-player mode**: Play against a friend by taking turns.
- **Grid-based layout**: 3x3 grid where players place their marks (X or O).
- **Win detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won by getting three marks in a row.
- **Draw detection**: The game detects when the grid is full and there is no winner, resulting in a draw.

## How to Play
1. Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns to mark a spot on the 3x3 grid.
2. Players select their spot by choosing the grid position they want to mark.
3. The game will automatically detect if there is a winner or if the game ends in a draw.
4. If a player wins or the game is a draw, the game will reset for a new match.

## Technologies Used
